        <h2>Story of The Walking Dead</h2>
        <section class="transparent">
          <p>A virus of unknown origins spreads over earth , causing the dead to rise from the grave and hunger for human flesh.</p>
          <p>A group of survivors lead by Rick Grimes, is one of humanities last chances to reform and rebuild, but others enjoy the chaos, and abuse the lawless land to get what they want. </p>
          <p>Rick Grimes' son Carl, is raised into this apocalyptic wasteland. He ends up becoming a leader, and like his father, tries to make earth a civilized place again.</p>
          <p>Whether the world will go back to being the way it was is unknown. Their only hope is to try to make the best out of the worst situation. Fighting the dead, and fearing the living.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>Main Characters</h2>
        <section class="transparent">
          <p>The three main characters of The Walking Dead are most definitely:</p>
          <img class="photo" src="../Images/twd-rick.jpg" alt="Rick Grimes holding an axe, ready for battle."> <img class="photo" src="../Images/carl.jpg" alt="Carl without an eye looking into camera."> <img id="michonne" src="../Images/michonne.png" alt="Michonne with sword in hands">
          <p> <b>Rick Grimes(Left)</b>  is the leader of the group. Father of Carl Grimes, he's very a protective father and a sheriff, who has to break his oaths to protect the ones he loves. </p>
          <p><b>Carl Grimes(Middle)</b>  is the son of Rick Grimes. The wasteland is really the only life he's known. Growing up in the apocalypse. Carl is a extreme survivor, losing an eye at 9. He still goes on, determined not to die.</p>
          <p> <b> Michonne(Right)</b> is an ally to Carl and Rick. She carries walkers on leashes to silently walk through hoards, and uses her Katana to silently eliminate walkers without drawing attention.</p>

<h2>Main Villains</h2>
<section class="transparent">
  <p>There are many foes that Rick and his group face. These 3 are the biggest threats they've ever faced.</p>
  <img class="photo" src="../Images/negan.jpg" alt="Photo of Negan smiling"> <img class="photo" src="../Images/governor.jpg" alt="Photo of the Governor smiling"> <img id="alpha" src="../Images/aplha.jpg" alt="Photo of Alpha staring off into the distance">
  <p><b>Negan(Left)</b>is an amazing antagonist. He has such an authority being a leader of a gang. He takes half of peoples supplies every month. He eventually sides with Rick and the group.</p>
  <p><b>Governor(Middle)</b>is the leader of a settlement. He wages war against Rick and his group at the prison. He kill a lot of people, and becomes more and more maimed as his screen time goes on.</p>
  <p><b>Alpha(Right)</b>is the leader of the whisperers, a group of people who wear walker's skin and wander with hordes. Alpha's reign as leader of the whisperers isn't a long one, but in her short time she kills almost half the main cast.</p>
