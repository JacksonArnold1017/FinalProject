    <h2>The Story of Invincible</h2>
    <section>
      <p>The story of <b>Invincible</b> (without spoilers) is a super hero comic about teenager Mark Grayson(Invincible), son of world famous superhero Omni-Man(Nolan Grayson).</p>
      <p>Mark lives in the shadow of his father, until he gets his powers(super strength, flight, and regeneration.) which he uses to fight small class villains, which eventually turn into worldwide threats.</p>
      <p>Mark eventually finds a love interest with Atom-Eve, another superhero. Atom-Eve and Invincible fall in love with each other, becoming a duo and fighting side by side.</p>
      <p>Mark's half human and half alien. Making his life even harder then it has to be. Mark struggles between being a hero, a student, and friend. Mark's internal struggle makes for a bulk of the story's conflict.</p>

    <h2>Main Characters</h2>
    <section class="transparent">
    <p>There are many characters in <b>Invincible</b> , too many to list all of them, so we will narrow it down to the three "main characters".</p>
    <img class="photo" src="../Images/markgrayson.png.jpg" alt="Photo of Invincible Smiling">    <img class="photo" src="../Images/omni-man.jpg" alt="Omni-Man with arms crossed"> <img class="photo" src="../Images/atom-eve.jpg" alt="Atom-Eve shooting lasers from her hands.">
 
    <p><b>Invincible(Left)</b>  is the main character of the story. His internal conflict between wanting to be a hero and wanting to be college student make up for a bulk of the early story, but he later on embraces being the superhero that earth needs. </p>
    <p><b>Omni-Man(Middle)</b> is the father of Invincible, he comes from an alien race of super warriors, called Viltrumites. His mission is to take over earth, but over time he grows attached to the family he's made and abandons his mission. </p>
    <p><b>Atom-Eve(Right)</b>  is the love interest of Invincible. She's a failed government experiment, who becomes a hero. Able to bend atoms to her will, making literally anything she wants. Her and Invincible are inseparable, protecting the world together. </p>
    </section>
 <h2>The Main Villains</h2>
 <section> 
 <p>When talking about villains, it's hard to narrow it down because of the seer numbers. From pure story importance and plot, these three are the main villains of the story.</p> 
<img class="photo" src="../Images/thragg.jpg.jpg" alt="Photo of Thragg frowning"> <img class="photo" src="../Images/conquest.jpg" alt="Photo of Conquest frowning"> <img class="photo" src="../Images/battle-beast2.png" alt="Battle Beast standing upright, un-impressed.">
<p><b>Thragg(left)</b> is the main villain of <b>Invincible</b>. He is the strongest viltrumite, and also the leader of the Viltrum Empire. His goals are complete domination, and to be the strongest being in existence. </p>
<p><b>Conquest(middle)</b> is another powerful viltrumite. He works for Thragg as an enforcer. He comes to earth to finish omni-mans unfinished mission. Only to be sent back to Viltrum by Invincible,</p>
<p><b>Battle Beast(right)</b> is one of the most powerful beings in Invincible. His entire purpose is to find the strongest being and kill them. His lust for battle has made him insane, only caring for the fight.</p>
